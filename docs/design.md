# Design Document for 2048 Game Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the design decisions made during the development of the 2048 game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game aims to provide an engaging experience by allowing players to combine tiles with the same number to reach the target score of 2048.

## Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct components:

- **Game Logic**: Encapsulated in `game.py`, this module manages the core functionality of the game, including starting the game, checking win/loss conditions, and managing the game state.
  
- **Board Management**: The `board.py` file defines the `Board` class, responsible for managing tile placement, movement, and the overall state of the game board.

- **Tile Movement**: The `moves.py` module contains functions that handle tile movements in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and merging tiles.

- **Scoring System**: The `score.py` file manages the scoring system, tracking the player's score based on merged tiles.

- **State Management**: The `state.py` module handles saving and loading the current state of the game, allowing players to resume their progress.

- **Utility Functions**: The `utils.py` file includes various helper functions, such as generating random tiles and other utility operations.

## GUI Design
The GUI is structured to provide a user-friendly interface for gameplay:

- **Main Application**: The `app.py` file sets up the main GUI application, including window creation and event handling.

- **Controller**: The `controller.py` file acts as the intermediary between the game logic and the GUI views, managing user interactions and updating the display.

- **Views**: 
  - `board_view.py` is responsible for rendering the game board.
  - `tile_view.py` handles the rendering of individual tiles.

- **Styling**: The `styles.py` file contains styling information for the GUI components, ensuring a visually appealing interface.

## Functional Programming Principles
The implementation adheres to functional programming principles by emphasizing immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions where applicable. State management is handled in a way that minimizes side effects, promoting a clear flow of data throughout the application.

## Game Mechanics
- The game initializes with a 4x4 board and two random tiles with values of 2 or 4.
- Players can slide tiles in four directions using keyboard controls or GUI buttons.
- Tiles with the same number merge into one tile with their sum after a move.
- A new tile (2 or 4) appears at a random empty position after each move.
- The game ends when the player reaches 2048 or when no more moves are possible.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements include:
- Configurable board sizes beyond the default 4x4.
- Additional game modes or challenges.
- Enhanced animations and visual effects for tile movements and merges.

## Conclusion
This design document serves as a guide for the development of the 2048 game with a GUI. The modular architecture and adherence to functional programming principles aim to create a maintainable and enjoyable gaming experience.
